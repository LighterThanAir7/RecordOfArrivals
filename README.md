## About The Project

While working on my previous student jobs at Bofrost*, there was a need to manage record of arrivals. We were given printed excel sheets to fill them in with time of arrival and leave. At that time in college I was learning more about PHP and decided to experiment a little by creating a small project that will be able to track records of arrivals.

### The program has several functionalities

1. Enter Working Hours
2. Display Total Working Hours
3. Add a New Employee
4. Delete Employee

Note that all the data is being written to csv file in separate folder for "Workers / Zaposlenici".

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

1. Clone the repo or download as zip
2. Open Terminal and run command "php main.php"

## Usage

File Zaposlenici.csv is filled with some dummy data for testing purposes, feel free to delete all the data from it locally or by using "Delete Employee" option from the program.

When running the program you will be greeted with main menu where you can select which option to choose from and proceed from there.

Number of hours will be written in .csv file and also read when the option of "Display Total Working Hours" for certain employe is chosen.
